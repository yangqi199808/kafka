/**
 * This class captures the result of taking a topology definition sent by the client and using the current state of the topics inside the
 * broker to configure the internal topics required for the topology.
 *
 * @param topologyEpoch               The epoch of the topology. Same as the topology epoch in the heartbeat request that last initialized
 *                                    the topology.
 * @param subtopologies               Contains the subtopologies that have been configured. This can be used by the task assignors, since it
 *                                    specifies the number of tasks available for every subtopology.
 * @param internalTopicsToBeCreated   Contains a list of internal topics that need to be created. This is used to create the topics in the
 *                                    broker.
 * @param topicConfigurationException If the topic configuration process failed, e.g. because expected topics are missing or have an
 *                                    incorrect number of partitions, this field will store the error that occurred, so that is can be
 *                                    reported back to the client.
