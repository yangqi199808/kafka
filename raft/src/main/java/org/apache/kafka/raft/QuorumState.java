/**
 * This class is responsible for managing the current state of this node and ensuring
 * only valid state transitions. Below we define the possible state transitions and
 * how they are triggered:
 *
 * Resigned transitions to:
 *    Unattached:  After learning of a new election with a higher epoch, or expiration of the election timeout
 *    Follower:    After discovering a leader with a larger epoch
 *
 * Unattached transitions to:
 *    Unattached:  After learning of a new election with a higher epoch or after giving a binding vote
 *    Prospective: After expiration of the election timeout
 *    Follower:    After discovering a leader with an equal or larger epoch
 *
 * Prospective transitions to:
 *    Unattached:  After learning of an election with a higher epoch, or node did not have last
 *                 known leader and loses/times out election
 *    Candidate:   After receiving a majority of PreVotes granted
 *    Follower:    After discovering a leader with a larger epoch, or node had a last known leader
 *                 and loses/times out election
 *
 * Candidate transitions to:
 *    Unattached:  After learning of a new election with a higher epoch
 *    Prospective: After expiration of the election timeout or loss of election
 *    Leader:      After receiving a majority of votes
 *
 * Leader transitions to:
 *    Unattached:  After learning of a new election with a higher epoch
 *    Resigned:    When shutting down gracefully
 *
 * Follower transitions to:
 *    Unattached:  After learning of a new election with a higher epoch
 *    Prospective: After expiration of the fetch timeout
 *    Follower:    After discovering a leader with a larger epoch
 *
 * Observers follow a simpler state machine. The Prospective/Candidate/Leader/Resigned
 * states are not possible for observers, so the only transitions that are possible
 * are between Unattached and Follower.
 *
 * Unattached transitions to:
 *    Unattached: After learning of a new election with a higher epoch
 *    Follower:   After discovering a leader with an equal or larger epoch
 *
 * Follower transitions to:
 *    Unattached: After learning of a new election with a higher epoch
 *    Follower:   After discovering a leader with a larger epoch
